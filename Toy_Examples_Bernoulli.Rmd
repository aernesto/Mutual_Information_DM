Create a vector representing $N$ i.i.d realizations of the true environment $S$, at a single point in time.
For stationary telegraph process, $S\sim$Bernoulli$(1/2)$ at all times.
```{r}
N <- 60
pS <- 1/2
S <- rbinom(N,1,pS)
```
Create 3 observation variables and compute their mutual information with the environment.
The first variable has Gaussian noise.
```{r}
sigma=.1
x_Gauss <- rnorm(S, mean=S, sd=sigma)
```
```{r}
muti(S,x_Gauss)
```

The second variable is the sign of the LLR of the first variable.
```{r}
likelihood
x_LLR <- LLR(x_Gauss, likelihood)
```
